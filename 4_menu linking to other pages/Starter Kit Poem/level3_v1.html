<div class="l3v1-title">Dulce et Decorum Est<div class="l3v1-author">by Wilfred Owen</div></div>

<div class="l3v1-poem"><b>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, <br>
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, <br>
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, <br>
And towards our distant rest began to trudge. <br>
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, <br>
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; <br>
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots <br>
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind. <br>

Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling <br>
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, <br>
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling <br>
And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—<br>
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, <br>
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. <br>

In all my dreams before my helpless sight, <br>
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. <br>

If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace <br>
Behind the wagon that we flung him in, <br>
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, <br>
His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; <br>
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood <br>
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, <br>
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud <br>
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,— <br>
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest <br>
To children ardent for some desperate glory, <br>
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est <br>
Pro patria mori.</b>
