<p>Bent double, like old <b>beggars</b> under sacks, 
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 
Till on the <b>haunting</b> flares we turned our backs, 
And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, 
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 
Drunk with <b>fatigue;</b> deaf even to the hoots 
Of gas-shells dropping <b>softly</b> behind.</p>

<p>Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of <b>fumbling</b>
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, 
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling 
And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—
Dim through the <b>misty</b> panes and thick green light, 
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. </p>

<p>In all my <b>dreams</b> before my helpless sight, 
He plunges at me, guttering, <b>choking,</b> drowning.</p>

<p>
If in some <b>smothering</b> dreams, you too could pace 
Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 
His hanging face, like a <b>devil’s</b> sick of <b>sin;</b>
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 
Obscene as <b>cancer,</b> bitter <b>as</b> the cud 
Of <b>vile,</b> incurable sores on innocent tongues,— 
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest 
To children ardent for some <b>desperate</b> glory, 
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est 
Pro patria <b>mori.</b></p>
