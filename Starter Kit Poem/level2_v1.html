<center><div id="title-anchor"><div class="title"><a href="#patria-anchor">Dulce et Decorum Est<br></a>
by Wilfred Owen</div></div>

<div class="title">Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, </div>
<div class="title">Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, </div>
<div class="title">Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, </div>
<div class="title">And towards our distant rest began to trudge. </div>
<div class="title">Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, </div>
<div class="title">But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; </div>
<div class="title">Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots </div>
<div class="title">Of gas-shells dropping softly behind. </div>

<div class="title">Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling </div>
<div class="title">Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, </div>
<div class="title">But someone still was yelling out and stumbling </div>
<div class="title">And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—</div>
<div class="title">Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, </div>
<div class="title">As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. </div>

<div class="title">In all my dreams before my helpless sight, </div>
<div class="title">He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. </div>

<div class="title">If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace </div>
<div class="title">Behind the wagon that we flung him in, </div>
<div class="title">And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, </div>
<div class="title">His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; </div>
<div class="title">If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood </div>
<div class="title">Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, </div>
<div class="title">Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud </div>
<div class="title">Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,— </div>
<div class="title">My friend, you would not tell with such high zest </div>
<div class="title">To children ardent for some desperate glory, </div>
<div class="title">The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est </div>
<div id="patria-anchor"><div class="title"><a href="#title-anchor">Pro patria mori.</a></div></div>
