	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Wilfred Owen </p><br><br><br>

<p>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,</p>
<p>Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,</p>
<p>Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,</p>
<p>And towards our distant rest began to trudge. </p>
<p>Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,</p>
<p>But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;</p>
<p>Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots 
<p>Of gas-shells dropping softly behind. </p><br><br><br>

<p>Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling</p>
<p>Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,</p>
<p>But someone still was yelling out and stumbling </p>
<p>And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.</p>
<p>Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,</p>
<p>As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. </p><br><br><br>

<p>In all my dreams before my helpless sight,</p>
<p>He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. </p><br><br><br>

<p>If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace</p>
<p>Behind the wagon that we flung him in,</p>
<p>And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, </p>
<p>His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;</p>
<p>If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood</p>
<p>Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,</p>
<p>Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud</p>
<p>Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,— </p>
<p>My friend, you would not tell with such high zest </p>
<p>To children ardent for some desperate glory,</p>
<p>The old Lie: <i>Dulce et decorum est</p>
<p>Pro patria mori. </i></p>
