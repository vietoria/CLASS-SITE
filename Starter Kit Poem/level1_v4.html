   <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dulce et Decorum Est by Wilfred Owen Bent &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   double, like old beggars under sacks, &nbsp; 
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, &nbsp; 
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, &nbsp; 
And towards our distant rest began to trudge. &nbsp; 
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, &nbsp; 
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; &nbsp; 
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots &nbsp; 
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.

Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling &nbsp; 
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, &nbsp; 
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling &nbsp; 
And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.— &nbsp; 
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, &nbsp; 
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. &nbsp; 

In all my dreams before my helpless sight, &nbsp; 
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. &nbsp; 

If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace &nbsp; 
Behind the wagon that we flung him in, &nbsp; 
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, &nbsp; 
His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; &nbsp; 
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood &nbsp; 
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, &nbsp; 
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud &nbsp; 
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,— &nbsp; 
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest &nbsp; 
To children ardent for some desperate glory, &nbsp; 
The old Lie: <i>Dulce et decorum est &nbsp; 
Pro patria mori. </i></p>
